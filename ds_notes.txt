GitHub:
created a new data science folder
commands in gitbash:
cd Desktop/
git clone repository link 
cd folder_name
git config --global user.email "your email"
git config ==global user.name "your name"
cd repository_name
git add .
git status
git commit -m "changes of file added"
git push
git pull  

SQL:
Database is a logical,consistent and organized collection of related data that can be easily accessed,managed and updated.The main purpose is to operate large information of data(information)by storing,retrieving and managing data.DBMS is a software which is used to interact with the database.RDBMS organizes data into a table based data structure with a strict,predefined schema required.DBMS is a software that allows user to create  and maintain a database. 
Database architecture:
1.1-Tier architecture:Both UI &CPU in one system.(Accessing from the same system.)
2.2-Tier architecture:The UI will be in one machine.(The UI in one machine and DBMS in another machine)
3.3-Tier architecture:There will be one UI and multiple machines.(Multiple UI,Multiple DBMS,Multiple systems)

SQL COMMANDS:
1.DDL-Data Defintion Language(Create,Alter,Drop,Truncate)
2.DML-Data Manipulation Language(Insert,Update,Delete)
3.DCL-Data Control Language(Grant,Revoke)
4.TCL-Transaction Control Language(Commit,Rollback)
5.DQL-Data Query Language(Select)


1.\L-TO VIEW A DATABASE
2.\dt-to view a table in a database
3.create database database_name
4.\d-to display a table
5.\c-to connect a database to a table
6.create table table_name(var_name_1 var_type,var_name_2,var_type);
7.insert into table_name values(arg_1,arg_2);
8.select * from table_name;-to view the data inserted in the table
9.alter table table_name add var_name_3 var_type;
